## NLP in Python

Text Analysis is the process of analyzing text data
to better understand what is being said and the meaning
behind it. In other words, it is natural language
processing.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of
artificial intelligence where computers process
and understand human language.

We can see the word frequency (how many
words appear more often in our text), run
sentiment analysis (to determine if our text
is generally positive or negative), and
discover common topics in our text.

We'll use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
Package, an industry standard, to perform
natural language processing.

Leveraging these analyses can help us better
understand human behavior, provide language-based
solutions, and learn more about text products.

Common applications include translators (between
two languages), spell checkers (on a text
application), virtual assistants, and spam filter
for filtering out spam emails.
